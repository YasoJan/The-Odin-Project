    <p>Canned produce is just as nutritious as fresh and frozen, and in some cases even better! The canned tomatoes in this hearty shakshuka recipe contain more antioxidants than fresh!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 medium onion, diced</li>
      <li>1 red bell pepper, cored, seeded, and diced</li>

      <li>⅛ teaspoon hot pepper sauce (such as Tabasco)</li>
      <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
      <li>1 (4.5 ounce) can chopped green chiles, drained</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>

      <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C).</li>
      <li>Heat oil in a 12-inch oven-proof or cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Add onion, bell pepper, and garlic; cook until crisp-tender, about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in cumin and hot pepper sauce; cook 1 minute.</li>
      <li>Add crushed tomatoes, green chiles, salt, and black pepper; bring to a boil over high heat. Simmer until mixture has thickened and flavors are blended, 6 to 8 minutes.</li>

Everything in "CSS" is a box

Padding --> occurs on the inside of the background of the element. It goes around the content of the element.

Border --> The outer layer of the box 

Margin --> Outside of our border 

Box Model --> In the box model margin collapses between two elements near each other! If the two elements have different margins, the larger one will be used!

    - Box Model additionally makes height and width specific to the content inside the box not the box itself. To change this you must specify  

      box-sizing: border-box;

margin: auto; --> centers a box
